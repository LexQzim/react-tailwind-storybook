This project is just a playground for react and tailwind components which will be published in storybook. 
I really like this components that's why I choosed them. Next.js is only the base for this project and won't be used any further. 
When I find a better way to handle it, then I will change it. 

If you want to create and publish your own components then feel free to create a PR. 

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install 

yarn run storybook
```

Storybook gets autodeployed by pushing on main. You will find it in [chromatic](https://65d919f660872832da7c87d7-lkaznambla.chromatic.com)
